# Description

An app that functions as a workspace. A semi clone of the [Momentum](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/momentum/laookkfknpbbblfpciffpaejjkokdgca?hl=en) chrome extension but designed to work on browsers besides chrome.  
A low-fi hip hop video loops music throughout the page and the bottom right includes a task list that users can add to.  
The app was designed, so that users can relax to the music while working on accomplishing their tasks, without scrolling  
to another tab where they can get distracted.

It uses webpack to bundle the modules into one bundle and each module is written in an Immediately Invoked Function Expression.

# Possible future improvements

- Find a way to let users put their own youtube music in the center of the video (might not be possible with new youtube guidelines)
- Media queries to help the app scale on mobile devices
